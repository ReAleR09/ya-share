So, google won't take my money for developer's account, so i can't publish this extension to store.
So, the only way to use it is to install it's unpacked version as if you are a developer and aiming to debug it :)

Steps to install
1) Download this repo as .ZIP
2) Unpack it
3) Head to Chrome's "Extensions" tab
4) Click "Load unpacked" and point at the just unpacked directory
5) Open/reload Ya.Music page and You shall see a big dumbass button appeared in the player's controls panel
