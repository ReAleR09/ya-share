So, google won't take my money for developer's account, so i can't publish this extension to store.
So, the only way to use it is to install it's unpacked version as if you are a developer and aiming to debug it :)

Steps to install
1) Download this repo as .ZIP
2) Unpack it
3) Head to Chrome's "Extensions" tab
4) Click "Load unpacked" and point at the just unpacked directory
